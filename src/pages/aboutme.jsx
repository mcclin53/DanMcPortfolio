            <p>
                My name is Dan McClintic. I am a student of the Full-Stack Coding Bootcamp.
                I have worked in the Social Services field for over 10 years and love to 
                help people. I have strong communication skills, a heart for service, and 
                a creative mindset. My family is my world. I have a wife, 2 kids, and a dog 
                and I love to spend as much time as possible with them. My main hobbies 
                include gardening and playing music but I enjoy learning and exploring new 
                skills as well. Although I have enjoyed my work, I would like to have the
                ability to express my creativity and challenge myself further in my career.
                Please take a look at my porfolio to see some of the projects that I have
                completed so far and contact me as well.
